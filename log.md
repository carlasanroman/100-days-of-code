# 100 Days Of Code - Log

##### hey there! thanks for stopping by. first, i'd like to explain why i've decided to start a #100daysofcode project. i'm a graphic designer in need of coding guidence. i know html and css fairly well and have some jQuery/javascript past experience. so, recently i  decided that i want to have the skillset as a front-end developer - i do enjoy coding (the sometimes menial) html and css + i just really want to make websites functional and beautiful. Basically, combining two things i love: Design and the internet :)



### day 01 â€” oct. 24, 2018
**Today's Progress**: I'm starting with Free Code Camp's 'Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures' basic javascript, aaand i set up this, so that counts as 'coding' related. 

**Thoughts:** I actually have about half of the basic javascript lessons done and today completed ~10. I found some things were difficult, but most of the time it was because i didn't read the whole thing. d'oh
