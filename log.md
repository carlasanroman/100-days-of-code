# 100 Days Of Code - Log

##### hey there! thanks for stopping by. first, i'd like to explain why i've decided to start a #100daysofcode project. i'm a graphic designer in need of coding guidence. i know html and css fairly well and have some jQuery/javascript past experience. so, recently i  decided that i want to have the skillset as a front-end developer - i do enjoy coding (the sometimes menial) html and css + i just really want to make websites functional and beautiful. basically, combining two things i love: design and the internet :)



### day 01 — oct. 24, 2018
**Today's Progress**: I'm starting with Free Code Camp's 'Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures' basic javascript, aaand i set up this, so that counts as 'coding' related. 

**Thoughts:** I actually have about half of the basic javascript lessons done and today completed ~10. I found some things were difficult, but most of the time it was because i didn't read the whole thing. d'oh


### day 02 — oct. 25, 2018
**Today's Progress**: I completed twice as many javascript lessons today than yesterday. I used the book "javascript & jquery" by jon duckett as a back up resource (i'm a visual learner.) Also, I completed the Golf Code lesson in one try. yeee

**Thoughts:** Today felt good. Sure, I forgot a semi-colon and was stuck for a minute, but the momentum was there. I was on fire~ It helped using the js & jquery book; That book is so darn beautiful. Plus, it makes javascript easy to understand. *Note to self - create my own javascript operators cheat sheet.* 


### day 03 — oct. 26, 2018
**Today's Progress**: I learned about switch statements and using them to simplify if else statemtents. 

**Thoughts:** Switch statements is something entirely new to me. I found this to be a bit difficult to learn, since i JUST got a refresher on if/else statements. Once you think you have something down, there is another way of writing it out and simplifying it. I stopped once i hit the counting cards lesson. its a bit overwhelming (+ i have to get ready to go to a concert:)


### day 04 — oct. 27, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Learned about javascript Objects. 

**Thoughts:** I struggled on this one. I'll have to revisit some of these lessons to really get it to stick :(
